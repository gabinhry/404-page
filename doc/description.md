Hi, the goal of this module is to provide you a way to correctly implement a 404 page. If you want to implement this (and you should), you're at the right place.

A normal React.js page is sent with the status 200, which states that all is good. Our objective here is to **redirect user to 404 if necessary**.

Thank to that, there won't be any confusion when Google's bot will try to index your website.

You'll find in the module: 
- Source code
- Documentation and Quickstart
- Complete integration on a React front
