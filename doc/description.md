The goal of this module is to provide you a way to correctly implement a 404 page. A normal React.js page is sent with the status 200, which states that all is good. Our objective here is to **provide a status 404 whenever the user arrives on the 404 page**.

Thank to that, there won't be any confusion when Google's bot will try to index your website.
